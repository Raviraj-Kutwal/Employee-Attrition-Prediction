# Employee Attrition Prediction

[![Open in Colab](https://colab.research.google.com/assets/colab-badge.svg)](https://colab.research.google.com/github/Raviraj-Kutwal/Employee-Attrition-Prediction/blob/main/Employee_Attrition_Prediction.ipynb)

This project uses machine learning to predict whether an employee is likely to leave an organization (attrition) based on historical HR data. It is built as part of a data analytics and machine learning internship at iGurus Consultancy Services LLP.

## üìå Problem Statement

Employee attrition is a major concern for companies due to the high cost of recruiting and training replacements. This project applies supervised learning to classify employees as likely to stay or leave based on attributes like age, job satisfaction, monthly income, overtime, and years at company.
